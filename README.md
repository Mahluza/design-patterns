# Singleton Design Pattern
**The singleton pattern is used when you want one instance of a class. One use case is a logger where you want to perhaps record all the operations a calculator performs. The code in this repository has been designed for a quick illustration of Singleton. Therefore, no calculator is implemented, only a simple Logger class, along with some JUnit tests, and an Exception.**
### Directory Structure:

* Logger.java implements the log.<br>
* LoggerTest.java tests some aspects of the Singleton.<br>
* RepeatException.java creates an exception that is thrown when the Singleton is violated.
