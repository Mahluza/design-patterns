# Singleton Design Pattern
***The singleton pattern is used when you want one instance of a class. One use case is a logger where you want to perhaps record all the operations a calculator performs. The code in this repository has been designed for a quick illustration of Singleton. Therefore, no calculator is implemented, only a simple Logger class.***
